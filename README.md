# ChokeBot
A muti-servo controller that accepts input from any shift-register based controller (for best results it should be a NES classic controller).  The code provides control for a base servo that rotates the whole arm, one elbow joint that can lift the head up and down, one head servo that can twist the claw, finally two claw servos that are mirrored and can close or open.  There is additionally a serial interface for disabling and enabling individual servos for testing or locking servos into place while still allowing the controller to interface with the remaining servos.

While this code is a comical nod to Archer it is in no way affiliated with Archer or the copyright holders of Archer.

Please use safety when using your ChokeBot at home, it has been known to crush pool balls.
